# 🔄 Caesar Cipher Program

Caesar Cipher is a timeless encryption method that shifts each letter of your message by a chosen number of positions in the alphabet. This Python game lets you encode and decode messages effortlessly!

## Features

✉️ __Encrypt & Decrypt:__ Quickly convert messages into secret code or decode them back.
🔡 __Keeps Numbers & Symbols:__ Your numbers, symbols, and spaces remain intact during encoding/decoding.
♻️ __Flexible Shifting:__ Handles shift numbers larger than the alphabet size, ensuring smooth operation.
🔁 __Replay Option:__ After each operation, choose to run the cipher again with a new message.


## How It Works

__Choose__: Type 'encode' to encrypt or 'decode' to decrypt.
__Input__: Enter your message.
__Shift__: Provide a shift number to set the cipher's rotation.
__Result__: The program returns the encoded or decoded message.
__Repeat__: Optionally, restart the cipher to encode or decode more messages!
